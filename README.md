# String comparison and classification with Word2Vec and CNNs

This repository contains notebook demos on encoding strings as images using the Word2Vec model and performing predictions on those images using ML techniques. I recently came across a reasearch paper which takes a similar approach for detecting malware. We can probably apply some of the concepts they worked on to this problem space.

## To try it yourself
1. Clone this repository
2. `pip install git+https://github.com/tteigman/string2image`

## Use cases
- Data cleansing by detecting strings in a data field that are out of place (and putting them in place)
- Domain specific fuzzy string matching
