# String comparison and classification with Word2Vec and CNNs

This repository contains a notebook demo on encoding strings as images using the Word2Vec algorithm and performing predictions on those images using ML techniques. I recently came across a reasearch paper that I will use to guide my techniques.

## Use cases
- Data cleansing by detecting strings in a data field that are out of place (and putting them in place)
- Domain specific fuzzy string matching
